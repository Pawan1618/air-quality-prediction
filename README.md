ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

City â€“ Name of the city where measurement is taken

Date â€“ Timestamp of measurement (daily/hourly depending on source)

PM2.5 â€“ Particulate Matter 2.5 micrometers (Âµg/mÂ³)

PM10 â€“ Particulate Matter 10 micrometers (Âµg/mÂ³)

NO â€“ Nitric Oxide (Âµg/mÂ³)

NO2 â€“ Nitric Dioxide (Âµg/mÂ³)

NOx â€“ Any Nitric Oxide compound (ppb)

NH3 â€“ Ammonia (Âµg/mÂ³)

CO â€“ Carbon Monoxide (mg/mÂ³)

SO2 â€“ Sulphur Dioxide (Âµg/mÂ³)

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Steps

Duplicate removal â€“ Removed duplicate records.

Column standardization â€“ Cleaned column names (lowercase, snake_case).

Date parsing â€“ Converted Date column into proper datetime format.

Missing values â€“ Handled [null], NaN, and invalid entries:

Replaced missing pollutant values with median imputation.

Numeric conversion â€“ Converted pollutant columns to float.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analysis was performed:

Summary statistics for pollutants.

Missing values heatmap to identify data quality issues.

Histograms of pollutant distributions.

Correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between pollutants.

City-wise comparison (Top 10 cities by PM2.5).

Time series trends (e.g., PM2.5 levels over time).
